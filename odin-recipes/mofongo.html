    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>4</strong> green plantains</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> lb of chicharron (crunchy pork skin)</li>
        <li><strong>3</strong> garlic cloves, mashed</li>
        <li><strong>4</strong> teaspoons of olive oil</li>
        <li><strong>2 </strong> cups frying oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the plantains, cut them into 1 1/2-inch slices, soak them in salty water for 15 minutes, drain them and dry them before putting them on the hot skillet with oil.</li><br>
        <li> Fry them for about 12 minutes at medium-low heat or until they turn light brown. Make sure to turn them. Do not brown them too much, so they are easy to mash. Stick a fork in them to check if they are done. </li><br>
        <li>Remove them and mash them on a mortar. Add some mashed garlic and pieces of chicharr√≥n.</li><br>
        <li>Once you have mashed all the plantains, mold them into the shape of half sphere using your hands or a container. Serve hot with chicken broth or your favorite meat.</li><br>
    </ol>
